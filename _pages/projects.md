## Some selected projects:

* __Security-Elasticity dependency analytics for Industrial IoT Infrastructure__
    * Status: _June/2020 - Ongoing_ 
    * Prototype to be released soon ;)
    * About: 
        * This framework is able to perform cross-layer cross -system dependency analytics inside an IIoT network.
        * Aids the IIoT developer in generating concrete dependency between two services inside the IIoT infrastructure. 


* __An implementation of Dynamic Adaptive DNN Surgery for Inference Acceleration on the Edge__
    * Status: Complete
    * Code: [LINK](https://github.com/rohitshubham/special_assignment_2020)
    * About:
        * This is the implementation of DNN Surgery Light (DSL) algorithm originally published by Chuang Hu et. al. in IEEE INFOCOM 2019 [1].
        * It has been implemented in python3 using pytorch DNN library. This implementation uses VGG-16 as the underlying architecture
