## Some selected projects:

* __Harvesting Tables in the Wild__
    * Status: _September/2020 - Feb/2021_ 
    * Code: [LINK](https://github.com/D2KLab/HarvestingTablesInTheWild/)
    * About: 
        * Pipeline to harvest high-quality tables from multiple sources such as web and common crawl.
        * Implemented highly-scalable distributed architecture using cloud-native tecnologies including multi-modal databases (ArangoDB) and message brokers (Kafka). 

<br/>

* __Security-Elasticity dependency analytics for Industrial IoT Infrastructure__
    * Status: _June/2020 - Aug/2020_ 
    * Prototype to be released soon ;)
    * About: 
        * This framework is able to perform cross-layer cross -system dependency analytics inside an IIoT network.
        * Aids the IIoT developer in generating concrete dependency between two services inside the IIoT infrastructure. 

<br/>

* __An implementation of Dynamic Adaptive DNN Surgery for Inference Acceleration on the Edge__
    * Status: Complete
    * Code: [LINK](https://github.com/rohitshubham/special_assignment_2020)
    * About:
        * This is the implementation of DNN Surgery Light (DSL) algorithm originally published by Chuang Hu et. al. in IEEE INFOCOM 2019 [1].
        * It has been implemented in python3 using pytorch DNN library. This implementation uses VGG-16 as the underlying architecture

<br/>

* __C# implementation of Automatic TextSummarization and keyword extraction__
    * Status: Complete
    * Code: [LINK](https://github.com/ebenso/TextSummarizer)
    * About: 
        * This is the C# implementation of Automatic TextSummarization and keyword extraction based on TextRank algorithm [2].
        * This project came out as an intiative to improve the open-source library for C# and is inspired by one of the popular TextRank implementations for [Python](https://github.com/davidadamojr/TextRank).
