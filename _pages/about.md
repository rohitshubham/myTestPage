I am currently pursuing *Joint Masters Degree* in [Security and Cloud Computing](https://secclo.eu). I have completed three semesters ( first two at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi) and third at[Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) in France) with my second-year specialization in Big Data Security. 

I am working on my Master's thesis on `Establishing cross-system trust between IIoT microservices` at Aalto University under Prof. [Hong-Linh Truong](https://users.aalto.fi/~truongh4/) in the [AaltoSEA Group](https://rdsea.github.io/) as a Research Assistant.  Previously I researched security-elasticity reliability in Industrial IoT systems in the same group. Before that, I briefly worked as Research Assistant under Prof. [Tuomas Aura](https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/tuomas-aura) on the implementation of EAP TLS-1.3 PSK based authentication. I am also the TA for Big Data Platforms for spring 2021 semester.

I was awarded the EMJMD scholarship for my master's degree. Before starting my masters, I worked as a full-stack engineer at Factset Research Systems. I received my bachelor's degree in 2016 in Computer Science and Engineering from [National Institute of Technology Patna](http://www.nitp.ac.in). My bachelor's project titled "IoT Enabled Smart Home Shopping Assistant System" under the supervison of Prof. [Prabhat Kumar](http://www.nitp.ac.in/php/faculty_profile.php?id=prabhat@nitp.ac.in). 

Research Interests
===
My research interests include cloud computing and distributed systems and services. More specifically, I work on the security, elasticity and consistency of the distributed microservices and systems.   

I also love reading and understanding distributed databases especially the newSQL distributed database paradigm.

Skills
===
My skillset includes:

* _System Architecture_: Creating cloud-native IaaS and PaaS end to end big-data platform architectures including orchestration using Kubernetes
* _Databases_: SQL, NewSQL, and NoSQL
* _Stream Processing_ softwares such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink. 
* Popular _Brokers_, _middlewares_ and _protocols_ such as Kafka, MQTT and RabbitMQ.
* Security Analysis of cloud deployed microservices. 

Hobbies
===

I like reading books and novels and I am especially fond of high-fantasy series such as Lord of the Rings or Eragon. I am also reader of few Mangas and japanese light novels. More recently, I have dabbed into Chinese [Wuxia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia). 

I also like playing Table-tennis and binging random tv series.
