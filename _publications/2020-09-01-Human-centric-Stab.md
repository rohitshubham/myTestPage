This paper proposes an innovative and effective digital video stabilization technique, which utilizes foreground features present in the video to produce consistent and stabilized output. It uses successive stages of Boosted HAAR cascade and representative point matching digital motion stabilization algorithm to identify and stabilize the video. The feature based tracking of object improves motion estimation accuracy between two frames thereby increasing the correlation calculation and compensation motion vector. This work achieves a significantly smoother sequence after the motion compensation.
